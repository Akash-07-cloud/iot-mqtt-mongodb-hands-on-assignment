# iot-mqtt-mongodb-hands-on-assignment
IoT project: MQTT-based device simulation, MongoDB storage, alerting system â€” hands-on + assignment work.
# IoT MQTT MongoDB Cloud Project

ðŸš€ This repository contains my cloud module work + assignment project involving MQTT communication, MongoDB storage, and alert logging.

## Folders
- `/cloud/` : Contains cloud hands-on work â€” device publishers, subscriber, and alert system.
- `/assignment2/` : (Optional â€” only if you have separate assignment code)

## What this project does
- Simulates IoT devices publishing vitals and room temperature data via MQTT
- Stores real-time data in MongoDB
- Generates alerts for threshold breaches (heart rate, blood pressure, room temperature)

## Tools
- Python
- Mosquitto MQTT
- MongoDB
- VS Code

## How to run
Run these scripts in separate terminals:
